G'day and welcome to a quick look at creating a DotNet Core (2.0) App using [Serilog]([Serilog](https://serilog.net/)). 

In this scenario, we will use the DockerHub image for DotNet Core 2.0.  The current `dotnet` KataCoda image reflects the `microsoft/dotnet:2-sdk` Docker image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/tags/).
